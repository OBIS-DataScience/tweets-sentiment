# Sentiment Analysis with Twitter Data

This repository contains Python code for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. It utilizes the Tweepy library to access Twitter data, performs sentiment analysis using the TextBlob library, and visualizes the results. The code provides insights into sentiment trends related to specific topics or keywords on Twitter.

## Usage

1. **Twitter API Access**: Before using the code, you need to access the Twitter API. Make sure to update the `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` variables in the Python script with your API credentials.

2. **Collecting Twitter Data**: The code collects tweets related to a specific topic (e.g., "#iPhoneX") from Twitter. You can modify the `q`, `lang`, and `since` parameters to specify your search criteria.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis is performed using TextBlob. Tweets are classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on their emotional content. The sentiment labels are added to the dataset.

4. **Data Export**: The resulting dataset, including sentiment labels, is exported to a CSV file for further analysis and visualization.

## Sentiment Analysis Approach

The sentiment analysis approach used in this code includes the following steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Text data from tweets is preprocessed to remove special characters, punctuation, and stop words. URLs and user mentions are also handled.

2. **TextBlob for Sentiment Classification**: TextBlob is used to assign polarity scores to each tweet. Positive, neutral, and negative sentiments are determined based on polarity scores.

3. **Labeling Sentiments**: Sentiment labels are assigned to each tweet in the dataset based on the polarity score.

4. **Data Export**: The dataset with sentiment labels is exported to a CSV file for further analysis and visualization.
